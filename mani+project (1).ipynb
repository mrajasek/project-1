    "              Reporting the electrical activity from heart over a period of time using electrodes placed on human skin. These electrodes observe microscopic electrical changes on the skin that araise from heart muscle's electrophysiological pattern of depolarizing and repolarizing during each heart beat.Electrical waves will travel through limited areas of the heart. Muscular cell in the heart contracts when electrical signal is recieved. These changes can be detected in electrical environment around the cell as micro voltage. Graphing the voltage as function of time monitors the pumping of heart. Normal rhythms produces four entities they are P-waves, QRS complex, T waves, U wave. It is used to detect heart attack, shortness of heart.\n",
    "     EEG(electroencephalogram) detects the electrical activity in brain using electrodes attached to the scalp. Brain cells communicate through electrical impulses and active all the time. EEG determines the voltage change by ironic current within the neurons of the brain. These signals are generally identifies as delta, theta, gamma based on signal frequency range from 0.1HZ to 100HZ. Main application of EEG is diagnostic test for epliepsy.\n"
